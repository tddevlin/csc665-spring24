# CSC 665: Artificial Intelligence
San Francisco State University, Spring 2024

**Instructor:** Tyler Dae Devlin (tddevlin@sfsu.edu)

**Time:** 11:00 AM to 12:15 PM, Tuesdays and Thursdays

**Location:** HUM 386

**Office hours:** Tuesdays 10 -- 11 am and Thursdays 12:15 -- 1 pm, TH 434

**Course description:** This course surveys some of the main techniques that have been developed over the past ~70 years in an attempt to create "artificial intelligence." Topics include search, game playing, logic, constraint satisfactions problems, probabilistic graphical models, machine learning, and deep learning.

**Optional textbook:** [_Artificial Intelligence: Foundations of Compoutational Agents_](https://artint.info/3e/html/ArtInt3e.html), David L. Poole & Alan K. Mackworth, 3rd edition.

**Grading:** The final grade will be based on the following components:
- 60% homework assignments (6 assignments worth 10% each)
- 20% midterm exams (2 exams worth 10% each)
- 20% final exam
- 2% participation (extra credit)

<!-- | 48%  | homework assignments (6 assignments worth 8% each)    |
| 30% | midterm exams (2 exams worth 15% each)     |
| 20%    | final exam    |
| 2% | participation | -->

Letter grades will be assigned according to the following cutoffs:

| [93, 100] |  A |
| [90, 93)  | A- |
| [87, 90)  | B+ |
| [83, 87)  | B  |
| [80, 83)  | B- |
| [77, 80)  | C+ |
| [73, 77)  | C  |
| [70, 73)  | C- |
| [67, 70)  | D+ |
| [63, 67)  | D  |
| [60, 63)  | D- |
| [0, 60)   | F  |

The left endpoint of any of these intervals may be lowered at the end of the semester, but the right endpoints will not be increased.

**Late work:** All homeworks are due at 11:59 pm on Mondays and should be submitted via Canvas. Late submissions will be assessed a 10% penalty per day after the due date, up to a maximum of 5 days late. Each student is granted one late waiver which can be used to exempt any homework assignment from the late penalty; the late deadline in this case is still 5 days after the normal due date (i.e. 11:59 pm on the Saturday of the same week).

**Other details:** See [the syllabus](https://syllabus.sfsu.edu/syllabus/2243-8248/view) for the complete list of course policies.

Just the Class is a GitHub Pages template developed for the purpose of quickly deploying course websites. In addition to serving plain web pages and files, it provides a boilerplate for:

- [announcements](announcements.md),
- a [course calendar](calendar.md),
- a [staff](staff.md) page,
- and a weekly [schedule](schedule.md).

Just the Class is a template that extends the popular [Just the Docs](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs) theme, which provides a robust and thoroughly-tested foundation for your website. Just the Docs include features such as:

- automatic [navigation structure](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/docs/navigation-structure/),
- instant, full-text [search](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/docs/search/) and page indexing,
- and a set of [UI components](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/docs/ui-components) and authoring [utilities](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/docs/utilities).

## Getting Started

Getting started with Just the Class is simple.

1. Create a [new repository based on Just the Class](https://github.com/kevinlin1/just-the-class/generate).
1. Update `_config.yml` and `README.md` with your course information. [Be sure to update the url and baseurl](https://mademistakes.com/mastering-jekyll/site-url-baseurl/).
1. Configure a [publishing source for GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages). Your course website is now live!
1. Edit and create `.md` [Markdown files](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) to add more content pages.

Just the Class has been used by instructors at Stanford University ([CS 161](https://stanford-cs161.github.io/winter2021/)), UC Berkeley ([Data 100](https://ds100.org/fa21/)), UC Santa Barbara ([CSW8](https://ucsb-csw8.github.io/s22/)), Northeastern University ([CS4530/5500](https://neu-se.github.io/CS4530-CS5500-Spring-2021/)), and Carnegie Mellon University ([17-450/17-950](https://cmu-crafting-software.github.io/)).

### Local development environment

Just the Class requires no special Jekyll plugins and can run on GitHub Pages' standard Jekyll compiler. To setup a local development environment, clone your template repository and follow the GitHub Docs on [Testing your GitHub Pages site locally with Jekyll](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll).
